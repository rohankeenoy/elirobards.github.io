        <h1><strong>Tattooing</strong></h1><br><hr>
        <p> <strong> Eli Robards </strong> is a tattoo artist in St. Louis, Missouri. He is currently an apprentice at <strong>St. Louis Tattoo Company.</strong> For years he has dreamt of becoming a tattoo artist, practicing as much as he can for as long as he remembers. He is skilled in most tattoo forms, however, his main interest is in realistic pieces. Eli is 22 years old and a drummer, artist, and a damn good guy. His spare time is spent working out, traveling, and making noise. <br> <br>

        <h2><strong>Music</strong></h2><br><hr>
        <p> Eli has been playing drums since his freshman year of high school. He hadn’t really played before, but figured the best way to learn would be to play with some of his best friends, as loudly as he can.  Ever since then he has been practicing hard and has had his hand in a few projects playing out at various venues around St. Louis.<br><br> Eli's most recent projects include 
          <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/deafcastle">Deaf Castle</a> and <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/5JNtpmIudSOqjIR1NIHl1r?si=vvLXWZo6Tv-WtogfpVpYog">Short Fuse</a>. He has also played in the groups Reeling, Yearlong Hours, and Overtake.</p>
